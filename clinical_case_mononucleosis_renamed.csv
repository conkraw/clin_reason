Streptococcal pharyngitis is possible due to sore throat and tonsillar exudates but doesn’t explain splenomegaly or posterior nodes. Peritonsillar abscess is less likely due to lack of trismus or uvular deviation. Other causes like TB or lymphoma are much less likely in this acute febrile presentation.",infectious diseases / adolescent medicine

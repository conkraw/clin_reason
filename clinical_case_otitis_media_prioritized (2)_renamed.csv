A1B2C3D4,16-month-old girl brought in by her mother for fussiness and fever,"O.M. has had a cold for 3 days, with runny nose and cough, and last night she developed a fever and increased fussiness. She refuses to eat and only wants her bottle. Last night O.M. woke up crying and was inconsolable until she got ibuprofen for fever, and was finally able to go back to sleep. Mother says she acted like this 3 months ago when she had an ear infection, and she is worried that she has one again.",Ear infection 4 months ago; resolved with treatment,Ibuprofen for fever,None,Up to date (UTD),,,"Temp 38.9°C (102°F), HR 130, RR 32; Weight 12 kg (80%)","Gen: fussy but consolable girl who is crying tears and drinking from her bottle. HEENT: mucous membranes are moist and clear. Crusting rhinorrhea noted. Pharynx unremarkable. Left TM slightly injected, but light reflex and landmarks clearly visible. Right TM opaque and red with irregular surface, disturbed light reflex, and non-visualized bony landmarks. Shotty anterior cervical adenopathy, greater on right. No nuchal rigidity or photophobia. Lungs: clear, no signs of respiratory distress. Remainder normal.",Please select and prioritize 3 diagnoses?,"Acute Otitis Media, Otitis Externa, Viral Upper Respiratory Infection, Meningitis, Bacterial Pneumonia, Pharyngitis, Foreign Body in Ear, Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), Sinusitis, Influenza",Acute Otitis Media,Viral Upper Respiratory Infection,Otitis Externa,"Acute Otitis Media is supported by the presence of fever, fussiness, and a red, bulging, opaque tympanic membrane with no visible bony landmarks. These findings are classic for a middle ear infection. Viral URI is also possible given the recent cold symptoms, but does not explain the focal ear findings. Otitis externa is less likely given the patient’s age and absence of ear canal tenderness or drainage. Other choices such as meningitis or pneumonia are unlikely due to a lack of supporting systemic or respiratory findings.",infectious diseases / ENT

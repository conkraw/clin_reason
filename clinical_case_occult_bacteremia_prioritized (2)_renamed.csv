Although usually a vigorous breastfeeder, he has been taking only small amounts of milk and has vomited once this morning. Today O.B. is difficult to arouse for feeds, and his parents also note that he seems to be breathing quickly.

UTI is also plausible in febrile infants without a source, though the urinalysis was negative. Meningitis is a serious consideration in this age group but was ruled out with a negative lumbar puncture. Other options like viral syndrome or pneumonia are less likely due to the infant’s clinical presentation, lab findings, and negative CSF and urine results.",infectious diseases / pediatrics

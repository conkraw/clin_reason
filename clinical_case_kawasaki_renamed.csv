3J4AQDG3,15-month-old girl brought in by her mother for fever and refusal to drink,"H.D. was well until last night, when she felt hot to the touch and refused her bottle. After some Tylenol she seemed better. Mother later noticed “spots” on her hands and a diaper rash. Since this morning H.D. has been irritable, pushing away her bottle, and less playful. Her temp at home was 104°F and she was given another dose of Tylenol. Mother brought her in because she was concerned about giving so much medicine.","Normal birth history, no major hospitalizations or serious illness",Tylenol for fever,NKDA,UTD to 1 year,"Lives with single mother, attends daycare; 6-year-old brother has asthma.

Roseola is possible due to age and fever, but the rash typically appears after fever subsides. Viral exanthem is plausible but lacks defining features. Sepsis and meningitis are less likely without hemodynamic instability or focal neurologic signs.",infectious diseases / pediatrics
